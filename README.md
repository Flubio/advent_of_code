# Advent of Code Repository

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges.

## Structure

Each year is organized in its own directory with the following structure:
```
YEAR/
├── day_01/
├── day_02/
├── ...
└── day_25/
```

## Language Selection

The programming language for each year is chosen based on what I want to learn or improve upon during that time period. This serves as both a coding challenge and a learning opportunity to explore new languages, frameworks, or programming paradigms.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the specific year and day you're interested in. Each solution includes the problem statement and implementation.
